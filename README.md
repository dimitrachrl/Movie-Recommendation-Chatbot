## Features

- User Input Analysis: The chatbot analyzes and understands user preferences through natural language processing techniques. It interprets user input and extracts relevant information about genres, actors, directors, or specific movies they like.
- Movie Database Integration: The chatbot integrates with a public movie database [TMDb](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) , to access movie details including genres, cast information, ratings, and reviews.
- Recommendation Generation: Based on the user's preferences and the movie database, the chatbot generates personalized movie recommendations. It utilizes techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to suggest relevant movies.
- Interactive Conversations: The chatbot engages in interactive conversations with users, asking questions about preferred genres, actors, or mood to refine the recommendation process and provide more accurate suggestions.
- Additional Movie Information: Users can access additional movie information such as plot summaries, release dates, trailers, or links to external reviews.
- User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with it through text input. Movie recommendations are displayed in a clear and appealing format, including movie posters, titles, and brief descriptions.
